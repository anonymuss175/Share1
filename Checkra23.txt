Dear Khun @Nanputita Pamai

 

On top of the request from previous mail, could you please provide more information as below krub:

 

Please kindly run the following 3 queries when connected to sqlplus as the ZDLRA monitoring user (specified at discovery time):

 

SELECT release_version , CASE WHEN REGEXP_COUNT(release_version, '\.', 1) <= 4 THEN release_version ELSE SUBSTR(release_version, 1, (INSTR(release_version, '.', 1, 5) - 1)) END AS base_version , zdlra_label , patch_level FROM (SELECT release_version , zdlra_version AS zdlra_label , release_version AS patch_level FROM raa_versions ORDER BY time DESC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1;

 

 

SELECT * FROM raa_versions;

 

 

SELECT version , label , (CASE WHEN TO_NUMBER(SUBSTR(version, (INSTR(version, '.', -1) + 1), (LENGTH(version) - INSTR(version, '.', -1) + 1))) > 100 THEN SUBSTR(version, 0, INSTR(version, '.', -1) -1) ELSE version END) base_version FROM (SELECT version , label FROM (SELECT SUBSTR(l.value, (INSTR(l.value, 'ZDLRA_') + 6), INSTR(l.value, '_LINUX.X64') - (INSTR(l.value, 'ZDLRA_') + 6)) version , SUBSTR(l.value, INSTR(l.value, 'ZDLRA_')) label FROM (SELECT value FROM rasys.config WHERE name='_build') l)); SELECT value FROM rasys.config WHERE name='_build';

 

 

Also run this query against the EM repository connected to sqlplus as SYSMAN:

 

SELECT target_name , property_name , property_value FROM mgmt$target_properties WHERE property_name IN ('RAVersion','RALabel','RABaseVersion') AND target_type='oracle_dblra';

Hi Khun @Nanputita Pamai

 

I believe the SR has been raised and resolution is being recommended.

 

In addition, I got another recommendation from product management team if ABA bank can attempt the following activity and see if it can solve the issue:

 

============================

 

To see if the Archival Backups page can be invoked by setting the URL in the browser to the page URL:

Visit Protected Databases page (where the buttons are not being shown). The URL will look like this (where zdlra_target_name is the actual target name).
…/em/faces/ambrDrilldownMainPage?type=oracle_dblra&command=ProtectedDb&target=zdlra_target_name

 

Change the URL to the following and press Enter (to try invoking the Archival Backups page):
…/em/faces/am-br-archival-backups?type=oracle_dblra&target=zdlra_target_name

 

Please let us know if the page display properly
